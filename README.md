# Titanic-prediction
This is a small prediction project using logistic regression where I predicted whether a certain traveller on the Titanic will survive the crash or not.

###Language Used: Python

####Steps Followed:
1.Import the packages /libraries to make it easier to write the program.
2. Load the data
3. Analyze the data by getting counts of data, survival rates, and creating charts
to visualize the data.
4. Get a count of the number of rows and columns in the data set. Note that each
row is a passenger onboard the ship and the columns are data points for each
passenger.
5. Get some statistics on the data set, such as the count, mean, standard
deviation, etc.
6. Get a count of the number of survivors on board the Titanic in this data set.
Notice that, in this data set, there were more passengers that didn’t survive
(549) than did (343).
7. Visualize all the required datapoints
8. Change the non-numeric data to numeric data, and print the new values.
9. Split the data into independent ‘X’ and dependent ‘Y’ data sets.
10. Split the data again, this time into 80% training (X_train and Y_train) and 20%
testing (X_test and Y_test) data sets.
11. Create a function that has within it many different machine learning models
that we can use to make our predictions.
12. Visualize the important features.
13. Test it against your data.
